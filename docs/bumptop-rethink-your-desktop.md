[BumpTop](http://bumptop.com/) is a fresh and engaging new way to interact with your computer desktop. You can pile and toss documents like on a real desk. Break free from the rigid and mechanical style of standard point-and-click desktops. Interact by pushing, pulling and piling documents with elegant, self revealing gestures. BumpTop's stunning interface makes clever use of 3D presentation and smooth physics-based animations for an engaging, vivid user experience.

BumpTop has people talking. A [video of the BumpTop interface](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ODskdEPnQ) is the most watched video of software on YouTube, ever. Other stories include NY Times, PCWorld, MIT Tech Review, Digg (twice) and others. BumpTop was also presented at TED 2007. We are in active development of the technology, stay tuned to the mailing list for release information.
