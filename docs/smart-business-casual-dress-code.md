The multinational presence of our company, the diversity of our partners and customers and the frequent exchange of visits with our customers, impose the implementation of a specific corporate dress code policy, in compliance with the relevant international business standards.
In doing so we collected material through an internet search and based our dress code policy on the practices followed by most IT firms in Silicon Valley.
The corporate dress code policy is the foundation on which one can build its business image and provide a respectful, civilized, productive work environment, where people of different genders, origin, culture and religion work together. The Smart Business Casual Dress Code fits the best the needs of our company and is defined by the following specific guidelines, currently widely applicable in corporate offices, internationally.

You are kindly invited to read them carefully and take them into consideration during your daily practice.

If you have a meeting scheduled with visitors, or if you are advised that others in the company will have visitors with whom you will come in contact, you may be requested to dress in more formal business attire.

## At the customer’s premises

During visits at the customer’s premises for the provision of technical services, the attire recommended is the same as at the company’s premises described above.
During visits at the customer’s premises for the participation in meetings, a more formal attire is required. The main guidelines follow:

**Tie**: A conservative tie is required. The top button of the collar of the shirt must be done up.

**Overcoat or raincoat**: If weather requires.
Suit Jacket: Plain dark suits are the safest option, but any good quality suit is suitable.

**Collared Formal Shirt**: Clean and well pressed. White is the universally preferred color. Light colors are acceptable. Avoid button down collars.

**Suit Trousers**: Must match the jacket.

**Formal Socks**: Ideally the same color as your suit. At least as dark as your suit.

**Formal Shoes**: Leather. Preferably black. At least as dark as your socks. Always wear lace up shoes.

**Belt**: Leather.

### Ladies:

**Suits**: Increasingly popular for ladies.

**Suit Skirt**: Must match the jacket. At least knee length.

**Formal Shoes**: Closed Toe.

**Jewelry**: A small amount of jewelry may normally be worn but should not distract from your status as a professional business person. Avoid religious symbols if possible.

## Conclusion

If clothing fails to meet these standards, as determined by the employee’s supervisor, the employee will be asked not to wear the inappropriate item to work again. If the problem persists, or is especially inappropriate, unprofessional, and/or offensive, the employee may be sent home to change clothes and will receive a verbal warning for the first offense. All other policies about personal time use will apply. Progressive disciplinary action will be applied if dress code violations continue.
As a general rule, we come to the office clean and tidy. In addition, please wear clothing and accessories that will project a professional image of you and the company for both visitors and coworkers. Wear:

- Attire that is clean, safe, and in good repair.
- Clothes which are not sexually provocative.
- Clothing that does not draw undue attention to one’s self or create a distraction for other employees.
- Clothing that will not be offensive to other employees.
