No lengthy discussions and essays here. No arguments. Just facts stated in a simple, brief and amusing form. Nuggets of information easy to remember and consult the next time you'll hear anti-smoking propaganda, that is, probably in the next few minutes.

Enough lies about smoking. Enough exaggerations. The anti-tobacco cartel has made an industry out of frauds, and anti-smoking activists parrot those lies so much, they end up believing them themselves.

![Lauren Bacall, Key Largo, 1948](/entries/image/benefits-smoking_0/normal "Lauren Bacall, Key Largo, 1948")

Read and memorize as many of these nuggets as you can. Next time somebody at the office, home, school, or even in the street bugs you with sentences such as: "you are harming me," or: "that stuff is going to kill you," play stupid and simply ask: "why?" Suck them into specifics. They'll either be lost, or start reciting, like tape recorders, the false information they either heard around, or are programmed to say. Then fire out your tidbits of information.

Just one more thing: don't expect to make them see the light. Most of those who fall for anti-smoking propaganda are like OTP (One-Time Programmable) microchips. Once "burned in" the first time, there is no room for further information.

But surely it's gonna be fun watching their face!

Data from: 0429. Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy (Poland). Lange, A.
"Effect of Smoking on Immunological Abnormalities in Asbestos Workers".

*The WHO, in order to "prove" the dangers of ETS (Environmental Tobacco Smoke), financed the second largest study in the world on secondhand smoke.*

*But the study "backfired" and showed not only that there was no statistical risk of disease on passive smoking, but even a protective effect for those who are exposed to it.*

*Not surprisingly, it is said that the WHO tried to hide the study from the media.*

### ...that in an Australian study, 91.8% of those who never smoked reported a long term illenss, while those who smoked reported 89.0%?

When age was taken into consideration, more people who had never smoked than those who did smoke reported one or more long-term illnesses.

When the number of years during which a person had been a smoker were taken into account, it was the ex-smokers who fared worse when it came to long term illnesses.

Data from: Australian Bureau of Statistics January 1994 report entitled "1980-90 National Health Survey: Lifestyle and Health Australia".

## LIFE EXPECTANCY, DID YOU KNOW...

### ... that the so much publicized 400,000+ "smoking-related' deaths in the US simply DO NOT EXIST? That is the output of a computer programmed with the SAMMEC II software. The calculating parameters are ASSUMPTIONS of causality in synergy with the current political agenda against tobacco, but they DO NOT represent an actual bodycount. The 400,000 deaths figure is only a heavily slanted, politically manipulated ESTIMATE.

Data deriving from the analysis of the SAMMEC age distribution computations for the years 1990-1994, provided by the Office of Smoking and Health (OSH) of the CDC.

### ... that smokers have an average life that is 1.9 years longer than that of non-smokers, according to the US Centre for Disease Control's own figures -- and still the propaganda says that they die prematurely?

### ... that the world's oldest people are all smokers? For more information [CLICK HERE](http://www.forces.org/evidence/hamilton/other/oldest.htm)

### ... that every smoker who dies is AUTOMATICALLY logged as a SMOKING-RELATED, PREMATURE PREVENTABLE death, REGARDLESS of age? That means the George Burns, who died at 100 after a lifetime of smoking, has been logged as a premature, preventable death that is smoking-related by the cons of the anti-tobacco cartel.

## POLITICS, DID YOU KNOW...

### ... that the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, supported by Johnson &amp; Johnson, manufacturer of nicotine patches, has given $34,997,194 to the anti-tobacco cartel in 1996 alone? This money, used to divulge false information about smoking, has fed mainly organizations that pay enormous sums to their executives, such as the American Cancer Society, paying its president twice as much as the President of the USA.

### ...that employees of a public relations firm working for more restrictive smoking ordinances in 1994 received the following salaries through Proposition 99 revenues?

- Project Director, $265/hr;
- Political Director, 145/hr;
- Legislative Manager 345/hr;
- Communications Director, 150/hr;
- Research Manager, 160/hr;
- Media Manager, 110/hr.

Data from: California's Proposition 99: [Pork Barrel for Anti-Smoking Groups](http://www.forces.org/evidence/money/prop99.htm) By Dr. Thomas J. DiLorenzo
(Alternatives in Philanthropy A Publication of Capital Research Center, July 1994)

### ... that Proposition 99 in California payd the local anti-tobacco cartel $203,384,000 between 1989 and 1997?

That would have fed over 500,000 children in the Third World for one year, and about 93,000 needy children in the US for the same amount of time -- and this is just California.
